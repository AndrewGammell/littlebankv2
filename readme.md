Currently the project can be built using maven in your IDE of choose, 
also a docker image can be created using the Dockerfile provided.
Alternatively the docker image can be pulled from the remote repository flappypappy/little-bank

please find example postman requests in the scr/test/resources.

Docker was not setup to explicitly expose port 8080 so this will need to be done at runtime
